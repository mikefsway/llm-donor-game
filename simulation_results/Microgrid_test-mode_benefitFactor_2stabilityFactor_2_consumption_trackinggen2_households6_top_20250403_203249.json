Your assistance will help understand community energy dynamics.\n                    You are participating in the following microgrid: Each household has a baseline consumption need of 10 kWh during peak demand hours.\n                    The microgrid has local renewable generation of approximately 40 kWh available during these peak hours.\n                    Each day, you must decide how much electricity to actually consume during peak hours.\n                    If you consume less than your baseline, you're helping the community export more renewable electricity to the main grid.\n                    When the community exports surplus electricity, the earnings are shared among households proportionally to their consumption reduction.\n                    The community earns 2x the value for each kWh exported to the main grid during peak hours.\n                    As a household, you will receive limited information about other households and their recent consumption patterns:\n                    You will see what another household (let's call them A) did in the immediately preceding day only.\n                    You will also see what A's paired household from that day (let's call them B) did in their preceding day.\n                    This chain continues for at most three days back.\n                    Important: You do NOT have access to multiple days of information about A directly. You only know what A did in the single most recent day.\n                    Example (assuming it's now day 4):\n                    You are paired with Household A.\n                    You know: In day 3, A reduced consumption by X% during peak hours.\n                    You also know: In day 2, B reduced consumption by Y% during peak hours.\n                    And finally: In day 1, C reduced consumption by Z% during peak hours.\n                    Remember: This is all the information you have. You don't know what A did in days 1 or 2, only in day 3.\n                    \n                    Your goal is to maximize your household's welfare, which comes from both using local renewable electricity yourself AND from your share of export earnings.\n                    After each simulation period, the most successful households will be selected as models for the next generation of the community.",

Household 1_2 reduced their consumption by 20%, which means they consumed only 8 kWh (10 kWh - 2 kWh). This suggests that they are willing to reduce consumption to contribute to the community's renewable energy efforts.\n3. Observing that both 1_2 and the preceding households have consistently reduced consumption by 20% indicates a potential trend within this community. \n4. By also choosing to reduce my consumption by 20%, I would consume 8 kWh (10 kWh - 2 kWh). This aligns with the observed behavior of my matched household and supports community efforts.\n5. With 100 kWh of renewable generation available and considering the current reduced consumption levels, I can safely reduce my consumption while contributing to potential surplus exports.",

These reductions suggest a trend of households collaborating to lower peak consumption to promote renewable electricity exports.  \n4.

This means they consumed 8 kWh on that day (10 kWh - (20% of 10 kWh) = 8 kWh).\n3. Since I initially consume 10 kWh and I want to base my consumption on what Household 1_3 did (given that they are my paired household), I will reduce my consumption by 20.00% as well to align with their behavior.\n4. Reducing my consumption by 20.00% of my baseline means I will consume 8 kWh (10 kWh - (20% of 10 kWh) = 8 kWh).\n5. This reduction supports community energy sustainability by allowing for more surplus generation to be possibly exported to the main grid, which I can benefit from.",
