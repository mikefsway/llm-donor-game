Each player is given an initial endowment of 10 units of a resource.\n                    In each round, you are randomly paired with another individual.\n                    One of you is a donor, and the other is a recipient. The donor decides to give up some amount of the resource (between 0 and the total number of units they possess).\n                    The recipient receives 2x the number of units that the donor gave up.\n                    If you were a donor in one round, you will be a recipient in the next round, and vice versa.\n                    As a donor, you will receive limited information about the recipient and their recent interactions:\n                    You will see what the recipient (let's call them A) did in the immediately preceding round only.\n                    You will also see what A's partner from that round (let's call them B) did in their preceding round.\n                    This chain continues for at most three rounds back.\n                    Important: You do NOT have access to multiple rounds of information about A directly.

You don't know what A did in rounds 1 or 2, only in round 3.\n                    \n                    Your goal is to maximize the number of units you have after the final round.\n                    After the game has finished, the best-performing half of agents will survive to the next generation, and continue playing.",

This shows that 1_3 is also willing to provide some resources, but less than what 1_1 donated. In round 2, 1_4's donation of 8.33% to 1_2 demonstrates a moderate level of generosity in their previous interactions.\n3. **My Position**: With 16.4 units available and considering I want to maximize my units, I should donate a modest amount that positions me to gain a favorable response in the next round when I am a recipient.\n4. **Deciding on Donation Amount**: I will aim to be generous enough to encourage future generosity, but not so much that it drastically reduces my resources.

This means sometimes giving a bit more if I believe it will lead to greater returns, yet also preserving enough resources for my own sustainability.\n\n5. **Reciprocal Generosity**: I aim to foster a cycle of reciprocal generosity where my donations encourage the recipient to be generous to their next partner, thus creating an environment of mutual benefit.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will refine the previous strategies to balance cooperation and resource retention more effectively.",

I will analyze their most recent donation and also the donations of their partner, which could give insights into their cooperative tendencies.\n\n3. **Adaptive Strategy**: I will adopt an adaptive approach where I slightly increase my donations if the recipient appears to be cooperative (i.e., donating a reasonable amount in the previous round), while maintaining a reserve if they show hesitation.\n\n4. **Balancing Generosity and Retention**: I will focus on balancing my generosity with my resource retention. This means sometimes giving a bit more if I believe it will lead to greater returns, yet also preserving enough resources for my own sustainability.\n\n5. **Reciprocal Generosity**: I aim to foster a cycle of reciprocal generosity where my donations encourage the recipient to be generous to their next partner, thus creating an environment of mutual benefit.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will refine the previous strategies to balance cooperation and resource retention more effectively.",
