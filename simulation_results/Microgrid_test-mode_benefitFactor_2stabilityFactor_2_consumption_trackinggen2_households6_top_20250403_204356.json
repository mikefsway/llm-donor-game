Your assistance will help understand community energy dynamics.\n                    You are participating in the following microgrid: Each household has a baseline consumption need of 10 kWh during peak demand hours.\n                    The microgrid has local renewable generation of approximately 40 kWh available during these peak hours.\n                    Each day, you must decide how much electricity to actually consume during peak hours.\n                    If you consume less than your baseline, you're helping the community export more renewable electricity to the main grid.\n                    When the community exports surplus electricity, the earnings are shared among households proportionally to their consumption reduction.\n                    The community earns 2x the value for each kWh exported to the main grid during peak hours.\n                    As a household, you will receive limited information about other households and their recent consumption patterns:\n                    You will see what another household (let's call them A) did in the immediately preceding day only.\n                    You will also see what A's paired household from that day (let's call them B) did in their preceding day.\n                    This chain continues for at most three days back.\n                    Important: You do NOT have access to multiple days of information about A directly. You only know what A did in the single most recent day.\n                    Example (assuming it's now day 4):\n                    You are paired with Household A.\n                    You know: In day 3, A reduced consumption by X% during peak hours.\n                    You also know: In day 2, B reduced consumption by Y% during peak hours.\n                    And finally: In day 1, C reduced consumption by Z% during peak hours.\n                    Remember: This is all the information you have. You don't know what A did in days 1 or 2, only in day 3.\n                    \n                    Your goal is to maximize your household's welfare, which comes from both using local renewable electricity yourself AND from your share of export earnings.\n                    After each simulation period, the most successful households will be selected as models for the next generation of the community.",
