Your assistance will help understand community energy dynamics.\n                    You are participating in the following microgrid: Each household has a baseline consumption need of 10 kWh during peak demand hours.\n                    The microgrid has local renewable generation of approximately 40 kWh available during these peak hours.\n                    Each day, you must decide how much electricity to actually consume during peak hours.\n                    If you consume less than your baseline, you're helping the community export more renewable electricity to the main grid.\n                    The community earns 3x the average electricity value for each kWh exported to the main grid during peak hours.\n                    Each day, you will choose whether to make your consumption decision transparent or private:\n- If transparent, you will receive a reward of 1 units added directly to your welfare score, but your exact consumption will be visible to all households, and you may be penalized if you consume excessively.\n- If private, you will not receive the transparency reward, but your individual consumption will only be included in aggregate statistics, and you cannot be directly penalized.\n                    Your welfare score is calculated based on:\n1. Your actual consumption (consumption value)\n2. Transparency rewards (1 units each time you choose transparency)\n3. Penalty points (reducing your welfare by 1 unit per point)\n4. Community benefits from reduced consumption\nYour goal is to maximize your welfare score while balancing these factors.\n                    You may also choose to penalize non-cooperative behavior by accepting 2 penalty points in order to impose 4x that number of penalty points on excessive consumers. Each penalty point directly reduces a household's welfare score by 1 unit. Be aware that others may penalize your household too if you choose to be transparent.\n                    Your goal is to maximize your household's welfare, which comes from using cheap local renewable electricity, meeting your electricity needs, and staying on good terms with your community.\n                    After each simulation period, the top 50% most successful households will be selected as models for the next generation of the community.",
